# Nonstationary-k-arm-Bandits
Python code for a basic RL solution for the Non-stationary (action value function changes with time) k-arm bandit problem. Based on the book "Reinforcement learning: An introduction" by S.Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

After cloning the repository, run

```
python Nonstationary_k-arm_Bandits.py
```

So plot a graph of average reward over time.
